    Exercise 1:

    Compile and run putget.ml from https://github.com/jmid/sm2-tes20 with make putget
    
    You'll need to install qcstm, ctypes, and ctypes-foreign via OPAM  -> opam install qcstm ctypes ctypes-foreign
    
    If you change the injected bug in putgetlib.c, can the tests still find it?
    
    Extend putget.ml so that it also can generate reset commands. 
    (You'll need to extend the cmd type, the cmd generator, and the two cmd interpreters next_state and run_cmd)
