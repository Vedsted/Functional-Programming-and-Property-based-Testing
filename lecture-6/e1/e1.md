# Exercise 1:

## 1. Compile and run putget.ml from https://github.com/jmid/sm2-tes20 with make putget
Files cloned placed in this dir.

Output from run:
```sh
# make putget      
ocamlbuild putgetlib.o
Finished, 1 target (0 cached) in 00:00:00.
ocamlbuild -I src -use-ocamlfind -package ctypes,ctypes.foreign,qcheck,qcstm,ppx_deriving.show -lflags putgetlib.o putget.native
Finished, 4 targets (0 cached) in 00:00:00.

--- Failure --------------------------------------------------------------------

Test put/get-model agreement failed (9 shrink steps):

[(Put 537); (Put 9); Get]
================================================================================
failure (1 tests failed, 0 tests errored, ran 1 tests)
```

## 2. Install qcstm, ctypes, and ctypes-foreign via OPAM
```sh
opam install qcstm ctypes ctypes-foreign
```

## 3. Change the injected bug in putgetlib.c, can the tests still find it?
Remember to 'make clean' before building again.

## 4. Extend putget.ml so that it also can generate reset commands. 
*You'll need to extend the cmd type, the cmd generator, and the two cmd interpreters next_state and run_cmd*

See files: `./putget.ml` and `./putgetprint.ml`
